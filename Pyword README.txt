Hey There! Thanks for playing PYWORD
Read this first to get instructions
in the zip file theres an EXE and a text file
THESE MUST BE PLACED IN THE SAME FOLDER AS EACHOTHER.
Someday I will work on a better version off this. to not require a .txt file but have it in the code!
I would admit chatgpt and videos made this game possible!
MACOS WILL BE HERE EVENTUALLY
